# Snack-Or-Booze-React
This is a simple React app that lists out snack and drink items for a cafe. It also allows a user to add more items to the menu. This app has no authentication; everyone can see everything and can add new items. 

# Starting Up
- Run *npm i* to install the dependencies 
- Run *npm start* to start the backend and frontend of the server
- The backend is available at http://localhost:5000/. This app uses the *json-server* node library, which creates a fully-featured JSON REST API from a JSON file. This is a RESTful JSON-oriented backend with two resources, drinks and snacks.
